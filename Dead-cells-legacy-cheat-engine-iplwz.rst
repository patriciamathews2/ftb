Posts:   · I also noticed something else a bit odd, the slot IDs will now have to be scanned for as an 8 Byte value. The game is using two identical DWORDs as the slot ID so you either need to replace the value twice in your tool, or in the case of cheat engine it's probably just easiest to use 8 Byte from now on (for finding and changing slots).Missing: dead cells.
