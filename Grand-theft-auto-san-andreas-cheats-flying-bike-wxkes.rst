I wanted to get into the airport but I dident have a high enough flying skill so I entered this cheat: Sqaure,L2,x,R1,L2,L2,left,R1,right,L1,L1,L, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas PlayStation 2.  · To exploit this glitch you first need to find a bike (no brainer), then you need to find a freight train and wait for it to stop. Do a bunny hop 95%(80).  · Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas took this idea to a whole new level, with more cheat codes than any of the other games in the long-running franchise.
